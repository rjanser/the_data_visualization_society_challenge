*ANNOUNCING THE FIRST DATA VISUALIZATION SOCIETY CHALLENGE* 

We're releasing a dataset of when members signed up, xy centroid of your city/state/country, and the average of their responses in the three categories (data, visualization, society) that we asked about. Make maps! Make animated timelines!! Blow our minds with unexpected viz choices of the other aspects of the data!

*Make vizzes, post them in #showcase, practice feedback in #critique, join #mapping-gis with your newly won map cred!*

*_Competition closes in 2 weeks_*

_Please note that we take your privacy very seriously, which is why the data is heavily redacted and not personally identifiable. If you see any issues, though, contact me or @Amy Cesal or @Mollz and we'll handle them_ (bearbeitet)
